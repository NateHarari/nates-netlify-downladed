          For this project, I decided on two different methods to fit the timeline, Interviews and surveys. I decided to
          conduct 30 mins long interviews with users who order food online on a regular basis. For surveys I used Survey
          Monkey, because everyone order food online, finding users wasn’t a problem.

          Overall, I held 32 of these interviews
        </div>
        <div class="the-first-10-minutes-Dd8PST new-body">
          The first 10 minutes of each interview focused on their day-to-day and how ordering food online fits into
          their days. We also discussed competitors and other products. The latter 20 minutes was spent doing a complete
          walkthrough of a product they use. I observed them using the app and then asked clarifying questions whenever
          necessary. I chose this method because it allowed me to understand people’s mental models of online food
          delivery and see how people interacted with the app. With this interaction, I could pinpoint the top pain
          points.
        </div>
        <div class="since-the-team-would-Dd8PST new-body">
          Since the team would use this information for a future roadmap, I wanted to make sure the findings were as
          reliable and valid as possible. In this case, I used the insights we found of the top pain points and surveyed
          over 100 users on each pain point&#39;s importance and current satisfaction.

          ordering food online and checking out restaurants. This helped me ensure I wasn’t just looking at power users
          that were “used to” existing products. Since every person eats twice a day, finding users wasn’t a big deal. I

          During the interview sessions, I used very open-ended questions. To ensure this was the case, I used the TEDW

          understand mental models and pain points without leading them. I feel that open ended question, visual
          question work best when interviewing people, people like to talk, specially about themselves, so visual

          Regardless of if the comapny will go into this market or not, I built a nice solid database from which we can
          extract information in the future. During the quarterly planning, the insights and the personas were used in
          the prioritization and planning process, the pain points were highlighted and are being tackled through
          ideation, prototyping, and more research. At a larger level, the marketing team was able to improve their

        <div class="as-an-exmaple-here-4BEd0r new-body">
          As an exmaple, here is a part from an interview with a potential user.
        </div>
        <div class="from-this-quick-inte-4BEd0r new-body">
          From this quick interaction, I can see clear pain points about the existing products. Things like delivery and
          price plays a big role in the decision making process. Overall, I held 32 of these interviews
        </div>
        <div class="q-how-often-do-y-4BEd0r new-body">
          [Q:] “How often do you order food online?”<br />[A:] “Hmmm about every other day I guess.”<br />[Q:] “What is
          the main reason for ordering food online?”<br />[A:] “ It’s cheap and super easy, plus, I got 4 roommates so
          cooking is a hassle.”<br />[Q:] “Would you order food if you lived alone?”<br />[A:] “Hmm not sure, probably
          yes but less frequent.”<br />[Q:] “How do you feel about the experience of ordering?”<br />[A:] “Tbh its super
          easy, kinda expensive and the food is cold sometimes.”<br />[Q:] “Did you ever complain about anything to the
          restaurant?”<br />[A:] “Yes, the food is often cold and messed up in the container.”<br />[Q:] “Is it a
          trade-off you thinking about before ordering?”<br />[A:] “Yes, I use the app cuz is faster but its more
          expansive…”<br />[Q:] “What would stop you from using the app?”<br />[A:] “Probably price and if delivery
          would take more than 30 mins.”
