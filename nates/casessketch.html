          Sketch is my faviourite software, by far. Not just for design but for everything. Your only skill cap is your
          creativity. I wanted to do an essay on the weak points of Sketch. Points that if addressed can increase
          adoption, revenue and user satisfaction. I’m fully aware that my understanding of Sketch will not always be
          currect and given my limited time in the industry, things in here might not be applicable or excepted but I’m
          determine to help the product I love the most. <br />I chose to tackle the following subjects.

          From the words of Simon Sinek, “Infinite companies play the infinite game.” Infinite statement should reflect

          I believe that by changing the vision statement or at least communicate differrent visions for different

        <div class="to-make-the-best-po-8dsmJN new-body">
          “To make the best possible tool for designers.” That a great vision, its truly is. <br />But Sketch never
          specified which designers. UI? UX? Web? Animation? Graphic? Motion? Interior? I don’t know what is the best
          tool because my requirements are deifferent to those who work in Graphics. I feel like the vision works well
          for the Sketch team and investors but it doesn’t make people stop what they’re doing and try Sketch for the
          first time.
        </div>
        <div class="on-the-other-hand-i-8dsmJN new-body">
          On the other hand, imagine Sketch’s vision as a call for something, something deep inside a designer’s heart,
          self expression. Imagine that Sketch’s vision will give any person a spark of creativity, the feeling of
          creating something. Imagine the vision as call to action to be different, to be unique and to self express.
          Design might not be an art form but any person can understand self expression, not just designers, and thats
          the crucial part.
        </div>
        <div class="im-a-big-fan-of-ske-8dsmJN new-body">
          I’m a big fan of Sketch, and yet, when I read this vision statement, I get the feeling that this is not
          address to me, i’m not a factor in the universe of Sketch and thats sad. There is no posible way for me to get
          behind the vision. Improving the vision statement can get people from all walks of life to try Sketch,
          designers from different types of disciplines, developers may want to try it for the first time and Sketch may
          be surprised by just how many new users will use Sketch just by changing the vision.
        </div>
        <div class="just-to-reiterate-w-8dsmJN new-body">
          Just to reiterate, when Sketch states “The best..” its a call for an argument, there is never a best tool or
          the best thing on the market and Sketch shouldn’t be a quality player in the market when it can be much more.

          designer who don’t know how to code use these softwares because Sketch is missing a fundemental selling point
          of website builders.

        <div class="from-interviewing-14-jkgEIe new-body">
          From interviewing 14 designers who build websites for a living, non of them use Sketch for the their work
          because “We can’t export the code and host it, we are not developers” According to them. The funny thing is
          that they all use Sketch for thier personal projects. More than that, 13 out of the 14 I interviewd pay a
          developer to code their work instead of doing it with Sketch. Sketch’s lack of ability to export code is
          failing to deliver the biggest selling point for web designers.
        </div>
        <div class="now-designers-who-a-jkgEIe new-body">
          Now, designers who are experienced in Sketch and coding, we go to the plugin store and use the Animaapp.
          Problem? Yes! The Animaapp costs $39/month. <br />I pay x4.4 times a month on a plugin than I pay for Sketch.
          Thats insane. Animaapp is a small, much less safisticated software than Sketch and yet, it managed to answer a
          massive need in the design community.
        </div>
        <div class="i-see-sketch-as-a-we-jkgEIe new-body">
          I see Sketch as a website, application, presentaion, book, photo grid, effects and animation builder. It is
          much more than any other website builder and yet, every person who ever typed “Website builders” into Google,
          never encountered Sketch. Sketch can easily implement a “Export HTML &amp; CSS” code option, it can even give
          us the option to export to GitHub and from there to Netlify. <br />Sketch to Netlify option is a website
          builder on its own.
        </div>
        <div class="the-part-about-the-a-jkgEIe new-body">
          The part about the Animaapp is just an exmaple, there are many other plugins that require the users to pay
          large sums of money. Sketch needs to look for expensive plugins and implement simillar features to Sketch. I
          pay $100/yr for Sketch but $112/month for plugins, that insane!
        </div>
        <div class="another-way-to-solve-jkgEIe new-body">
          Another way to solve this issue is to promote free or cheap plugins. Why not put a section in the notification
          tab for plugin of the day? This way Sketch can promote great plugins and get people to find another function
          in Sketch, thus increase the retention. Apple does it for the App Store, what is stopping Sketch to do the
          same?

          For example, let’s say someone downloaded Sketch for work related tasks. <br />This person have a very

          lost and frustrated. The user will probably try to figure things out but without any guides and time spent,

            or not, people use Sketch for all of those things. I want to give first time users the ability to
            immediately get a grasp of what Sketch is capable of. Beyond first users, this will help existing users try
            new things and test the abilities of Sketch, which will only increase adoption and recurring users.
            <br />This solution is cost effective and can be easily implemented.</span

          So a new user just finished his/her free trail and is looking to invest in Sketch. Theres not a lot Sketch is
          doing wrong at the phase, the payment is fair and easy to make. Now, I don’t know what are the convertion
          rates for Sketch but I’m guessing that there is a sizable precentage that can be converted with a few tweaks.

          Getting people to invest in something is tricky. Investing is something our mind try to avoid because
          investing is commiting, and the last thing our mind wants is to commit to something, especially something that
          will drain resources, like time and money. So how do we get a user to commit for a software like Sketch? “The
          smaller the action compare to the task, the better”.
        </div>
        <div class="example-some-poeple-HW5p1U new-body">
          Example, some poeple will say: “Sketch is $100/yr that expansive!” but no one will say “This car is expensive,
          its $100 to buy.” What happen there? The person spends the same amouth of resources but the size of the task
          is vastly different. At the point in which a user finshed the Free Trail, I want Sketch to make the software
          appear bigger to the eyes of the user, I want Sketch to connect with the user via email and notification tab
          using the Past, Present and Future marketing. A user who used a product for the entire duration of the free
          trail clearly likes the product and all the user needs is a slight push over the edge.

          These are all just exmaples and can be expended further, I beilieve that by actively “pushing” the user over

            want the user to stop but, here we use the concept of investment. The mind have a harder time letting go of
            something after the initial investment. We want the user to have more time investing emotionally in the

            mind a glimps of the road ahead, we mentioned “Community” something our mind crave beyond reason. We
            mentioned “Millions” the size of the community, another thing that will make it easier for the mind to
            invest resources. Lastly, we asked the mind for a simple action “Join”, this word is so important in sales

          So a user is hooked, he likes the product and use it frequently. What steps can Sketch take to keep that user

          a long time and never got any type of engagement from the company. This stage is critical in my opinion
          because any designer is constantly bombarded with advertising from new softwares, new work requirements and
          new features. Making sure the user feels at home and feel special is crucial for keeping the user.

            to cost resources and doesn’t have to be advertised. The new Call Of Duty doesn’t change a single thing in
            the real world, yet there are so much talk about it that people buy it just because of hype. Sketch can
            create a bit of a build up by engaging with users through the “Notification” Tab.<br /><br /></span

            for being part of our wonderful dream of design.” or something like that, something that will thank the user
            and give him a sense of inclusion, a sense of family. It can be automated and doesn’t require a lot of

            part of this vision? I can’t really, I mean, I can by paying for the software but that doesn’t really make
            any emotional connection. There is a psycological phemomenon that happens you ask a favor from someone, that
            person can get emotionally invested in helping you, escapcially if that person already likes you. Let’s say
            that I ask you to help me choose a new car, if you’re into cars, you would care what I buy and try to make
            sure I don’t end up buying a crap car. Same goes for softwares, every Sketch user is into Sketch on some
            level, asking them “a favour” can get them emotionally invested in Sketch, a thing that will increase
            adoption and retention. An example can be, poles. Something like: “Can you help us choose a new icon?” Of
            course Sketch doesn’t have to listen but the act of asking the users something, is what matter most. Another
            example can be, “Can you help us find a new feature to work on?”, again, Sketch doesn’t have to listen but
            by asking those things, Sketch just made the emotional connection with the user that much deeper. P.S it has
            to start with “Can you help…” in order to work, it must be phrased as a favour for Sketch.</span

          ><span class="span2-BOqVbq sfprodisplay-regular-normal-eerie-black-19px"
            >: From my research, I couldnt find any comapny/product that has been acquired by Sketch B.V. Thats not a
            bad thing but it leaves the door open for future aquasitions. Product acquisitions can range for buying a
            whole company to being a title sponsor. When Adobe bought Behance, they make a calculated marketing
            acquisition that will give them free advertisment and brand recognition. The type of acquisitions I want to
            see efrom Sketch can range from design blogs to sponsoring design schools, from sponsoring students to new
            startups. The marketing aspect of product aqusition comes from the branding and word-of-mouth marketing.
            Let’s say that Sketch will buy Procreate Art for iOS, on its own, it doesn’t serve any marketing advantage
            to Sketch but if Sketch want to go iOS in the future, it makes a lot of sense, plus it will be a way for
            Sketch to challange Adobe illustrator.<br /><br /></span

            >: In reality Sketch doesn’t rank for enough key words and thats a shame. The way we&nbsp;&nbsp;can improve
            it is by getting more articles out, more essays about Sketch. Sketch’s blog is great but not the best way to
            do it. The best way is to get other people to do it. Adobe managed to do it by implementing a Referral
            program, not something i’m in favour of but you can’t argue with success.<br />I want to see more traffic
            online about Sketch and by implementing a Referral it can be achieved.<br /><br /></span

            >: Sketch unlike Figma, can go the extra mile and become something like Adobe. Not every Adobe product but
            some of them.<br />I see a future where Sketch is in iOS and offers competitive sulotion to Adobe
            Illustrator and Procreate. I see a future where Sketch works with small startups to make sure the compony
            will grow while using Sketch. I see a future where developers get into the design sphere because of Sketch’s
            ability to bridge the gap by implementing similar features to SwiftUI.</span
