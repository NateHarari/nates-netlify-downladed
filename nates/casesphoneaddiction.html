          This solo case study is my response to a company trying to find a way to help kids who are addicted to their
          phones, ipad or video games. The company was at the research stage and didn’t have a product just yet. I
          wanted to include this case study in my portfolio because it demonstrates my understanding of behavior
          psychology and consumer habits. As a deisnger, I take pride in understanding people, understand thier needs
          and where those needs come from.

          So we figured out that kids are extremely active and social, what would happen if a kid is lonely and needs to
          be more social? What would happen is that his mind will try to find a way expand energy. Now, if a perent is
          relactent to provide a social setting, the mind will result to other behaviours like crying or yelling, the
          mind will test the reaction form the parent, which will be, in most times, some sort of reward in exchange for
          the kid not crying, like putting TV on or giving the kid a game to play on the phone. Welcome to a Negative

          A kid can get “addicted” to something because their mind treat the movie or the game as a supplement for
          social activity. If a parent puts the kid in a stroller when shopping, like a caged animal, of course the kid
          will cry and yell, why would you stop him from experiencing the world?!

        <div class="in-response-for-cryi-Lbyonr new-body">
          In response for crying the parent will put on a game on the iPad just to make the kid shut up. Of course it
          works for the short term but in the long term, it takes away from the child ability to experience the social
          environment, which will eventually lead to poor social skills.
